Hello and thank you for using our Automated Tests

In order to execute the tests here, there are a few of easy steps to follow:

1. Please ensure that your Chrome Browser is updated to the latest version (currently version 76.0.3809.100)
2. In GitHub, locate the Rocketmiles.jar and save it to your C drive. Take note of that folder's path (something like 'C:\Users\yourName\Documents\Rocketmiles')
3. Start Windows Command Prompt (Windows Key -> Run -> cmd) 
4. In Windows Command Prompt, change directory to where the jar file is located, which is the path that you noted in step 2.    (cd C:\Users\yourName\Documents\Rocketmiles)
5. After changing directory, type the following into the command prompt:
		java -jar Rocketmiles.jar
6. The test should execute. If there is a failure - most likely you need to upgrade your Chrome browser to latest version.
